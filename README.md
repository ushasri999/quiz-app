# quizapp
A monolithic application where the user will be able to perform CRUD operations on questions. 
So the user will be able to:  
i) view all questions  
ii) view all questions by category  
iii) add a question  
iv) update a question  
v) delete a question  

With questions, quizzes will be created where we will be able to:  
i) create quizzes  
   - specify the category of the question, for example, Week 10  
   - specify the number of questions and the title of the quiz  
   - upon successful quiz generation, a quiz id will be automatically generated  

ii) get a quiz by ID  
   - we can get the quiz by ID  

iii) We can also calculate the result of the quiz upon completing the quiz, i.e., after answering the quiz questions
